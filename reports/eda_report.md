Analysis Date: 2026-02-02
1. Dataset Overview
Total Records: 57
Observations: 30
Events: 10
Impact Links: 14
Targets: 3
2. Key Visualizations Generated
Account Ownership Timeline (2011-2024) - Shows growth trend with event markers
Growth Rate Comparison - Highlights the growth paradox
Account vs Mobile Money - Compares two key metrics
Event-Impact Network - Visualizes causal relationships
P2P vs ATM Transactions - Shows digital transformation milestone
3. Key Findings
3.1 The Growth Paradox
Account ownership growth slowed significantly (+3pp, 2021-2024) despite:

Telebirr launch (May 2021)
M-Pesa entry (Aug 2023)
4G coverage expansion (37.5% → 70.8%)
3.2 Digital Transformation Milestone
P2P digital transactions now exceed ATM cash withdrawals (ratio: 1.08)
This marks a historic shift from cash-based to digital economy.

3.3 Mobile Money Success
Mobile money accounts doubled from 4.7% (2021) to 9.45% (2024), showing strong adoption of digital services.

3.4 Impact Modeling
7 impact links created connecting events to indicators
Average lag: 9.6 months for effects to materialize
Strongest impact: M-Pesa launch (158% P2P growth)
Evidence basis: 4 empirical, 2 literature, 1 theoretical
4. Data Limitations
Sparse time series data (only 5 Findex points)
Mixed data types (percentages, counts, currency)
Limited gender-disaggregated data
No regional (urban/rural) breakdown
5. Next Steps for Forecasting
Complete remaining 7 impact links (total 14 needed)
Build time series models with event interventions
Forecast 2025-2027 for Access and Usage indicators
Create scenario analyses (optimistic/pessimistic)
Develop interactive dashboard for stakeholders
Report generated automatically from EDA analysis


## Temporal Coverage

We summarize which years have data across indicators and highlight sparse periods in the unified dataset.


## Confidence Distribution

We assess data quality by visualizing confidence levels (high/medium/low) across records.


## Access Trajectory & Growth Rates

Account ownership (2011–2024) with period-to-period growth: +8pp (2011–2014), +13pp (2014–2017), +11pp (2017–2021), +3pp (2021–2024).


## Infrastructure & Enablers

Explores relationships between 4G coverage, mobile penetration, ATM density and inclusion outcomes.


## Correlation Analysis

Correlation across indicators identifies potential leading predictors for Access and Usage.


## Key Insights

1. Inclusion growth slowed to +3pp despite massive registrations.
2. Usage correlates more with agent density and connectivity than raw registrations.
3. Interoperability milestones align with Usage upticks.
4. Urban-rural gap persists; targeted enablers needed.
5. Confidence varies; triangulation improves robustness.


## Data Quality & Limitations

Sparse time series, limited microdata, potential measurement differences between supply-side registrations and demand-side survey usage.
